# Enhancing Recipe Retrieval with Foundation Models


Official implementation of our ECCV2024 paper:

**[Enhancing Recipe Retrieval with Foundation Models: A Data Augmentation Perspective ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04763)**

This paper proposes a new perspective on data augmentation using the Foundation Model (i.e., llama2 and SAM) to better learn multimodal representations in the common embedding space for the task of cross-modal recipe retrieval.
